# JXA Builder

This was a heavy WIP (this may not fully work) that I never quite finished. I put it together for a talk I gave on the topic. I *think* it all works still. It's a way to use normal front-end build process tooling to create OS X apps in JS. **Milage may vary**

### Requirements

Install required global packages:

```
npm run reqs
```

### Creating a new app

```
npm run app:create
```

### Making code changes and recompiling

```
npm run app
```
